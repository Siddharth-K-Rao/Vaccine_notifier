# Vaccine Notifier
Notifies when a Covid-19 vaccine is available. Currently, it sends a notification when COVAXIN is available.
* Based on the user's requirements, he/she can be notified about the vaccine of their choice.
* Text to Speech has been added for ease of use.

***Create a virtual environment and execute the following commands.***

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python .\<File_name>.py

Works for Windows systems because of the use of 'winsound'. Replace by printing the bell character instead.
